# Week 2 Lab

# Introduction

This week your task will be to:
* capture the requirements and use cases for the target application.
* present the collected data from Week 1
* discuss approaches to data analysis for physical activity recognition.

We have prepared a sample Jupyter Notebook to show you how to read the files stored by the Android app and make a simple accelerometer plot. You can find it [here](http://localhost:8888/notebooks/Tutorials/Week%202%20-%20PDIoT%20data%20analysis.ipynb).

Some recommended readings for Human Activity Recognition papers are:
* [A Study on Human Activity Recognition Using Accelerometer Data from Smartphones](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050914008643)
* [Deep Learning for Sensor-based Human Activity Recognition: Overview, Challenges and Opportunities](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.07416.pdf)
* [Human Activity Recognition with Convolutional Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.01935.pdf)

You should start developing your Human Activity Recognition model using a deep learning library. We highly recommend using [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install) for its portability to Android devices.

For good tutorials on how to get started with Tensorflow we recommend:
* the official [documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/learn)
* online tutorials for HAR, for example [this one](https://towardsdatascience.com/time-series-classification-for-human-activity-recognition-with-lstms-using-tensorflow-2-and-keras-b816431afdff). This doesn't mean that you need to implement the same machine learning methods, but it does provide insight into how an end-to-end HAR system would work.
